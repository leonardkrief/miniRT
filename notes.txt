TO_DO:
	*find a nice way to alpha blend

DONE:
	*handle ppm files (20)
	*find a nice way to implement intersection datatype
		still not completely satisfied but better than none...

CURRENTLY_WORKING_ON:
	*rays

THOUGHTS:
	*I chose to not malloc t_intersection variables in my
		t_intersection_list. It is then faster because memory is used
		on the stack, but the union type is heavy memory-wise.
		Typically:	sizeof(t_sphere) = 40B
					sizeof(t_cylinder) = 48B
					sizeof(t_triangle) = 96B
		So all my unions will weigh 96B when they could have
		weighted 40B sometimes (right ?)
		Knowing that intersections are very very numerous (several per pixel),
		such a change would probably have sensible consequences on the
		performances.
		RESOURCES OPTIMIZATION POSSIBLE BY ALLOCATING t_intersection:
			+ less memory used
			- requires to allocate memory
			-- would probably run slower
